I used LLMs to create the mission, vision, objectives, architecture plan for Ocht. Then I used claude code to create a Q4 2025 demo - this was created very quickly.

I'm aiming to understand clojure (following elements of clojure) and polylith. And also learn to harness the power of LLM code assist tools such as claude code.
