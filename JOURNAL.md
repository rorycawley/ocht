I used LLMs to create the mission, vision, objectives, architecture plan for Ocht. Then I used claude code to create a Q4 2025 demo - this was created very quickly.

I'm aiming to understand clojure (following elements of clojure) and polylith. And also learn to harness the power of LLM code assist tools such as claude code.

I ran the poly tools and it's clear that claude code didn't really understand polylith. This idea of developing one small step at a time is still correct, I'm thinking I'll start from scratch again with this and shape claude code to taking one small step at a time.
